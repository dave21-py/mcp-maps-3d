## ‚ú® Overview

MCP Maps 3D is an interactive web application that showcases the power of combining large language models with real-world tools. It leverages the **Google Maps Photorealistic 3D Tiles API** to render a stunning, high-fidelity model of the entire globe.

The core of the project is a conversational interface powered by the **Google Gemini API**. Users can type natural language commands‚Äîfrom asking to see famous landmarks to requesting complex driving directions‚Äîand watch as the AI interprets their request and manipulates the map in real-time.

This is made possible by the **Model Context Protocol (MCP)**, which acts as a robust bridge, allowing the Gemini model to reliably call and execute custom "tools" that control the map's functions.

*   **Conversational Map Control:** Simply tell the AI what you want to see. No complex menus or buttons.
*   **Photorealistic 3D Globe:** Navigate the entire world in stunning, high-resolution 3D, from a global view down to individual buildings.
*   **AI-Powered Tool Usage:** The AI has access to two primary functions:
    *   `view_location`: Geocodes a text query to find its latitude and longitude, then flies the camera to that point.
    *   `directions`: Calculates a route between an origin and destination and draws it on the map.
*   **Powered by MCP:** Demonstrates a clean and effective implementation of the Model Context Protocol for connecting an AI model to a frontend application's tools.

## üöÄ Getting Started

To get a local copy up and running, follow these simple steps.

### Prerequisites

*   You must have [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/) installed on your computer (which includes npm).

### Installation

1.  **Clone the repo**
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/dave21-py/mcp-maps-3d.git
    ```
2.  **Navigate to the project directory**
    ```bash
    cd mcp-maps-3d
    ```
3.  **Install NPM packages**
    This will download all the necessary libraries for the project.
    ```bash
    npm install
    ```
4.  **Set up API Keys**
    The project requires API keys for Google Gemini and Google Cloud Platform.
    *   Create a new file in the root of the project named `.env`
    *   Add your API keys to this file in the following format:
        ```
        # .env file
        VITE_GEMINI_API_KEY="YOUR_GOOGLE_GEMINI_API_KEY"
        VITE_GOOGLE_MAPS_API_KEY="YOUR_GOOGLE_MAPS_API_KEY"
        ```
5.  **Run the project**
    This command starts the local development server.
    ```bash
    npm run dev
    ```
    Then, open your browser and navigate to the local URL provided (usually `http://localhost:5173`).

## üåê Deployment

This project is a static web application and can be easily deployed on platforms like **GitHub Pages**, **Vercel**, or **Netlify**.

When deploying, ensure you use your platform's system for managing environment variables (often called "secrets") to store your `VITE_GEMINI_API_KEY` and `VITE_GOOGLE_MAPS_API_KEY` securely. **Do not commit your `.env` file to your repository.**
